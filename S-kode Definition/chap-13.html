<h2>13.  <strong>ROUTINES</strong></h2>

&nbsp;
<p>Routines in S-code correspond to subroutines in other languages but with certain
restrictions: </p>

<ul>
  <li>All parameters are passed to and from the routines by value.</li>
  <li>Routines are not recursive (but the routine may possibly contain calls of the routine
itself. In that case the body of the routine will explicitly store and reload the
necessary values around such recursive calls).</li>
  <li>Any routine must exit through its <u>endroutine</u>, it is not possible to exit via any explicit
jump.</li>
  <li>The return address may be made available to the routine (by means of an <u>exit</u>
definition), thus allowing the return address to be changed by the routine itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>The definition of a routine creates two descriptors (of type VOID), describing the routine
<u>profile</u> and the routine <u>body</u>. In certain cases to be described later no body occurs in the
program.</p>

<p>The profile defines the parameter and exit descriptors for the routine, while the body
defines the local descriptors as well as the instruction sequence to be executed when the
routine is activated. Each routine body must have exactly one routine profile associated
with it, whereas a &quot;non-peculiar&quot; profile may be associated with several routine bodies. It
is not allowed for the same profile to be associated with more than one body in any
dynamic sequence of routines calling routines, since this would imply re-use of the (static)
allocation record defined by the profile.</p>

<p>The activation sequence for a routine is generated on the basis of the call instruction
treated in section 4 below.</p>

&nbsp;
<h3>13.1.  <u>Routine profiles</u></h3>

&nbsp;
<p>	routine_profile</p>

<p>		::=	<u>profile</u>	profile:newtag  &lt;peculiar&gt;?</p>

<p>			  &lt;import_definition&gt;*  &lt;export or exit&gt;?</p>

<p>			<u>endprofile</u></p>

<br WP="BR1"><br WP="BR2">
<p>	peculiar</p>

<p>		::=	<u>known</u>	body:newtag  kid:string</p>

<p>		::=	<u>system</u>	body:newtag  sid:string</p>

<p>		::=	<u>external</u>	body:newtag  nature:string  xid:string</p>

<p>		::=	<u>interface</u>	pid:string</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	import_definition</p>

<p>		::=	<u>import</u>	parm:newtag  quantity_descriptor</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	export_or_exit</p>

<p>		::=	<u>export</u>	parm:newtag  resolved_type</p>

<p>		::=	<u>exit</u>		return:newtag</p>

&nbsp;
<p>The import (input) parameters and the export (return) parameter are transmitted &quot;by
value&quot;. Each <u>import</u> (<u>export</u>) definition will declare a quantity local to the routine body
(bodies) later associated with the profile. The order in which the parameters are given in
the profile will define the correspondence between the formal parameter locations and the
assignment of the parameter value (<u>asspar</u> in the call instruction); the tag values (used in
the associated bodies) will also be allocated in this sequence.</p>

<p>An import parameter defined as a repetition must correspond to an <u>assrep</u> in the call, the
count specifies the maximum permissible number of values to be transferred. Note that
the actual count is not transferred, it should be defined as a separate import parameter.</p>

<p>An <u>exit</u> definition identifies a descriptor for the area containing the return address of the
routine. If no exit definition is given an an-onymous descriptor will be created for the same
area. The exit des-criptor is of the basic form (REF, PADDR, ...) and exists for the use of
<u>endroutine</u> (q.v.). If the descriptor is identified through <u>exit</u> it becomes accessible to the
routine exactly as any other local quantity, and in that case it will be possible for the
routine to change its return address. Such a routine cannot be called from other routines.</p>

<p>In general, only the profile:newtag and a possible body:newtag (in case the routine is
peculiar) are visible outwith any routine body associated with the profile. Observe that
routine parameters and exit tags are local quantities.</p>

<p>The parameter tags may, however, occur in the tag list of a module (see chapter 14).</p>

<p>Remark:	The above sentence was included for the time being, because of special
implementation strategy chosen by a subimplementor. The number of the
external tags in the run-time system will be drastically reduced when these
tags are removed from the tag list.</p>

&nbsp;
<h3>13.2.  <u>Peculiar routines</u></h3>

&nbsp;
<p>&quot;Peculiar&quot; provides information about routines whose bodies either will not be defined in
any S-program, or in the case of known routines may be safely skipped by the S-compiler.
Except for known no body may be associated with the profile; it uniquely defines one
routine. The body tag so specified will be used to refer to the routine in subsequent call
statements.</p>

<p>Peculiar routines are described in this way to permit the S-compiler to handle each one in
the most convenient system- and routine- dependent manner. In particular it is common
for system-provided routines to return the result in specific registers and not in store
locations. In these cases the use of peculiar routines will ensure that the export
descriptor, stacked following the <u>call</u>, describe the appropriate registers.</p>

<p>All peculiar routines are identified by a string (kid, sid, xid or pid) in the profile, since the
actual tags associated with such a routine will vary from S-program to S-program. The
string contains at most 6 characters with the case of any character being insignificant (e.g.
&quot;a&quot; is equivalent to &quot;A&quot;). All id strings for peculiar routine profiles contain only
alphanumeric characters, the first of which is a letter.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>known</u>  body:newtag  kid:string</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	A known routine has a body defined in S-code. The S-compiler may know the
working of the routine and may thus replace the body with an optimised code
sequence. It is intended to be used in cases where a standard S-code routine will
be in danger of being inefficient in some implementations, or when the routine call
can be replaced by an in-line code sequence at each call.</p>

<p>It should however be noted that it is necessary to simulate (in the S-compiler) a routine
spec for the body tag when processing <u>known</u> profiles.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>system</u>  body:newtag  sid:string</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	System profiles provide the interface to the run time environment of the program, or
they represent routines which are impossible to program in S-code (or potentially
prohibitively inefficient in all implementations). Thus no body will be given. Such
routines (e.g. date_and_time) are typically provided by the operating system on the
target machine, and may require special intervention from the S-compiler, since the
calling conventions and parameter passing mechanisms will be system-dependent.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>external</u>  body:newtag  nature:string  xid:string</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	External routines are routines written in other languages. The exact nature of the
routine is specified by the nature:string. External routines are implementation
dependent.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>interface</u>  pid:string</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	Interface profiles may occur in the head of the interface module only. The profile
becomes visible from the run time environment through the identifying string.</p>

<p>	Every profile associated to a routine address evaluation which is an actual
parameter to a system routine should be specified as an interface profile. An
interface profile cannot have more than ony body.</p>

<p>	In fact, the interface specification is redundant, but can be used to simplify code
production for routine address values.</p>

<p>	Interface routines cannot have more than one body.</p>

&nbsp;
<p>Note that when processing a <u>known</u> profile it is necessary to simulate a routine-spec for
the body tag in the S-compiler.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>13.3.  <u>Routine bodies</u></h3>

&nbsp;
<p>	routine_specification</p>

<p>		::=  <u>routinespec</u>  body:newtag  profile:tag</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	routine_definition</p>

<p>		::=  <u>routine</u>  body:spectag  profile:tag</p>

<p>			&lt;local_quantity&gt;* &lt;instruction&gt;*  <u>endroutine</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p>	local_quantity</p>

<p>		::=  <u>local</u>  var:newtag  quantity_descriptor</p>

&nbsp;
<p>The body:newtag identifies the routine body and is used as an argument to <u>call</u>, while
profile:tag connects the body to the relevant routine profile and is used as an argument to
<u>precall</u>, <u>asscall</u> or <u>repcall</u>.</p>

<p>Routine specification is used in cases where it is necessary to call an as yet undefined
routine, and in module heads.</p>

<p>A routine body will be compiled into a sequence of instructions to be executed when
activated by a call statement referencing the body tag. No quantities or descriptors
defined in the body are visible outwith that body; all such tags are destroyed at <u>endroutine</u>
and made available for re-use. As a consequence the syntax restricts the use of certain
constructs inside the routine body:</p>

<ul>
  <li>constants and general labels cannot be defined inside the routine,</li>
  <li>external modules cannot be inserted into routine bodies (see 14.3),</li>
  <li>routines cannot be nested, i.e. routine specifications or definitions cannot occur in
a body,</li>
  <li>all jump/destination sets must be fully enclosed within the body, except for
destinations of <u>goto</u> jumps.</li>
  <li>protect statements are not allowed inside routines.</li>
  <li>if, skip, and segment constructions are restricted when used inside routine bodies,
the restriction is syntactically specified as e.g. &quot;if_statement&quot; (invalid) versus
&quot;if_instruction&quot; (valid). The constructions are simply restricted so as not to allow
any of the above restrictions be violated.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<p><u>local</u>  var:newtag  quantity_descriptor</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	The local quantities constitute the local variables for the routine. Conceptually they
are static quantities, i.e. the descriptors will be complete. An implementation may
choose to make them dynamic, that is created each time the routine is activated,
and destroyed at routine exit.</p>

<p>	While the tags identifying the local variables not necessarily are generated in strict
sequence, they will at <u>endroutine</u> comprise an interval.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>routine</u>  body:spectag  profile:tag</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	An implied <u>bseg</u> (see chapter 12) is performed.</p>

<p>	The scope to the parameter tags defined in the associated profile is opened, and
all defined destination indices and label tags will temporarily lose their meaning.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>endroutine</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p>	All destination indices must be undefined, and the stack must be empty, otherwise:
error.</p>

<p>	An implicit <u>eval</u> is performed. Code is generated to transfer control to the program
point described by the exit descriptor, the scope to the profile is closed, and an
implicit <u>delete</u> is performed with the minimum local tag value defined in the routine
as argument. The label tags and the destination indices defined before <u>routine</u> was
evaluated regain their meaning. Observe, that since routines cannot be lexically
nested, it is sufficient to use (the equivalence of) two destination index vectors.
Finally an implied <u>eseg</u> is performed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>13.4.  <u>Routine activation</u></h3>

&nbsp;
<p>	call_instruction</p>

<p>		::=	connect_profile  &lt;parameter eval&gt;*  connect_routine</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	connect_profile</p>

<p>		::=	<u>precall</u>  profile:tag</p>

<p>		::=	<u>asscall</u>  profile:tag</p>

<p>		::=	<u>repcall</u>  n:byte  profile:tag</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	connect_routine</p>

<p>		::=	<u>call</u>  body:tag   !   &lt;instruction&gt;+  <u>call-tos</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p>	parameter eval</p>

<p>		::=	&lt;instruction&gt;+  <u>asspar</u></p>

<p>		::=	&lt;instruction&gt;+  <u>assrep</u>  n:byte</p>

&nbsp;
<p>The call instruction causes generation of the activation sequence for a routine. First the
profile is connected, this will provide information about the number and types of the
parameters. Following this the parameter values are evaluated and transferred, and finally
the actual routine to be activated is connected, either explicitly by giving the tag or
implicitly by taking its RADDR value from TOS.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>precall</u>  profile:tag</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	A copy of the profile descriptor is pushed onto the stack. This descriptor defines the
number and types of the parameters required and where they are to be placed.
Initially it identifies the first <u>import</u> parameter (if any). The descriptor will be
modified during the further processing of the call instruction.</p>

<p>	For each import parameter a parameter evaluation sequence follows, specifying
instructions which result in a descriptor of the actual parameter value on top of the
stack.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>call</u>  body:tag</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	The profile descriptor must now be in TOS, and it must not describe any import
parameter, otherwise: error.</p>

<p>	The generated code will transfer any parameters from the temporary area to the
parameter locations, and then perform a subroutine call to the body. The return
address (the current program point) will be remembered in the (explicitly named or
implicitly defined) exit area. How and when this remembering is done, is
implementation dependent.</p>

<p>	The profile descriptor is popped. If it indicates an <u>export</u> parameter, the
corresponding descriptor is pushed onto the stack as  (VAL, export.TYPE, ...).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>asscall</u>  profile:tag</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	TOS must describe a quantity of the same type as the first import parameter to the
given profile, otherwise: error.</p>

<p>	<u>asscall</u> makes it possible to call a routine when the first import parameter is already
on the stack. The evaluation of this construction will take place as if the TOS
element first is moved off the stack into some anonymous location, and then a
<u>precall</u> is simulated. Following this the former TOS is moved back to the stack on
top of the profile descriptor, and finally an <u>asspar</u> is simulated.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>repcall</u>  N:byte  profile:tag</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	TOS must describe a quantity of the same type as the first import parameter to the
given profile. This must be a repetition.</p>

<p>	<u>repcall</u> makes it possible to call a routine when the first import parameter is already
on the stack, and this is a repetition. The argument N must be less than or equal to
the number of elements in the repetition, and the type of the 'N' uppermost stack
descriptors must be identical to the type specified for the parameter. If these
conditions are not satisfied, the S- program is in error.</p>

<p>	The evaluation of this construction will take place as if the N uppermost elements of
the stack are first moved into some anonymous location, and then a <u>precall</u> is
simulated. Following this the former N stack elements are moved back to the stack
on top of the profile descriptor, and finally an <u>assrep</u> is simulated.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>asspar</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p>	At this stage SOS must be the connected descriptor (possibly modified by earlier
parameter assignments) and it must describe an <u>import</u> parameter of the same type
as TOS, otherwise error.</p>

<p>	The generated code will move the value of TOS into the temporary area. The stack
is popped and the profile descriptor is modified to describe the next parameter.
After a parameter assign the profile descriptor will remain on top of the stack.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>assrep</u>  N:byte</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	The profile descriptor in stack element number N+1 from the top must describe an
import parameter, which must be a repetition. The argument N must be less than or
equal to the number of elements in the repetition, and the types of the 'N'
uppermost stack descriptors must be identical to the type specified for the
parameter. If these conditions are not satisfied, it is an error.</p>

<p>	The 'N' values described by the top elements in the stack are assigned to the
elements of the repetition in the following order:</p>

<p>		The top element is assigned to the N'th element of the repetition and then
popped; then the new top element is assigned to the (N-1)'th repetition
element and popped, and so on until the N stack elements in question have
been assigned to the N first elements of the repetitive parameter.</p>

<p>	These assignments imply generation of deferred code. TOS will now be the routine
descriptor, which is modified to describe the next parameter.</p>

<p>	This facility is intended to be used to pass a variable number of parameters of the
same type to certain routines, in particular to routines associated with array
accessing.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>call-tos</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p>	TOS must be of type RADDR, and SOS must be the (modified) connected profile
descriptor, which does not describe any import parameters, otherwise: error.</p>

<p>	This is equivalent to &quot;call TOS&quot;, i.e. the routine address popped off the stack
identifies the entry point to a routine to be connected. It will normally not be
possible for the S-compiler to check, whether TOS actually is associated with the
profile. However, the value nobody should lead to a run time error.</p>

&nbsp;
<h3>13.5.  <u>Parameter transmission</u></h3>

&nbsp;
<p>Since OADDR and GADDR values are permitted as routine parameters, the transmission
of the parameters cannot in the general case take place directly into the parameter
locations. In order to make it possible for the garbage collector to identify such values, if
the g.c. is activated during parameter transmission, the values must be transmitted as
intermediate results, i.e. in the temporary area. All calls to the g.c. will be preceded by
<u>save</u>, thus consistency will be ensured.</p>

<p>The actual transfer of the values from the temporaries to the parameter locations
associated with the profile cannot take place before <u>call</u>.</p>
