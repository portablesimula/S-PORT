<p>The program head will contain the identification of the front-end compiler and other
information; the exact format is defined in (4). Program elements are not permitted within
routine bodies, while instructions are (see section 13.3).</p>

<p>The distinction between program elements and instructions is syntactically ambiguous in
the case of if-, skip-, protect- and segment-constructions; we emphasize that the syntax
given is intended to be descriptive rather than the base of an automatic compiler
generation scheme.</p>

<p>Any local quantities and descriptors are visible only from within the body of the main
program; all such tags are destroyed at <u>endprogram</u> and made available for re-use. They
are statically allocated and part of the main program throughout an execution, by analogy
with Algol's 'own'-variables. Their initial values are undefined.</p>

<h3>3.1.  <u>The primitive syntax symbols</u></h3>

<p>byte</p>

<p>	::=	an (8-bit) unsigned integer value in the range 0..255.</p>

<br WP="BR2">
<p>number</p>

<p>	::=	a two-byte value greater than or equal to zero. A number (or any other
multi-byte structure) will always be transmitted with the most significant byte
first. Let the bytes be &lt;B1&gt;&lt;B2&gt; in that sequence; the value will be 256 * B1
+ B2 .</p>

<br WP="BR1">
<p>ordinal</p>

<p>	::=	a number with value greater than zero.</p>

<br WP="BR1">
<p>tag</p>

<p>	::=	An ordinal (the &quot;tag-value&quot;) associated with a descriptor. See section 2.4.</p>

<p>	::=	The number zero followed by an ordinal (the &quot;tag value&quot;) and an identifying
string.</p>

<p>		The second form is intended for debugging purposes and is used to
associate an identification with the tag.</p>

<br WP="BR1">
<p>newtag</p>

<p>	::=	A tag-value with no association, see section 2.4.</p>

<br WP="BR1"><br WP="BR2">
spectag

<p>	::=	a tag-value which, if not undefined, must have been given an association in
a specification (<u>labelspec</u>, <u>constspec</u>, <u>routinespec</u>), see section 2.4.</p>

<p><br WP="BR2">
</p>
<p>index</p>

<p>	::=	a byte within an implementation-defined range which identifies an internal
label. An important side effect of its occurrence is that it looses its meaning.
Thus an internal label can be the destination of exactly one jump-instruction.
See section 11.2.</p>

<br WP="BR1">
<p>newindex</p>

<p>	::=	an index-byte which is undefined; it becomes defined as an internal label
through its occurrence. See section 11.2.</p>

<br WP="BR2">
<p>string</p>

<p>	::=	a byte with the value N followed by N &quot;data bytes&quot;. The character count N
must be greater than zero, thus a string cannot be empty.</p>
