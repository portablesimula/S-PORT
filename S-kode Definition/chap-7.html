<h2>7.  <strong>INTERMEDIATE RESULTS</strong></h2>

<br WP="BR1">
<p>During the compilation the stack will regularly contain items, which describe partially
evaluated expressions such as e.g. incomplete address calculations. The execution of the
corresponding machine instructions will at run time give rise to intermediate results; of
necessity these must be held in some form of anonymous storage, <u>the temporary area</u>.
The actual implementation of this area should be highly target machine dependent, thus
the machine registers may be used if a sufficiently large number of registers are available.</p>

<p>At <u>save</u> the intermediate results are copied from the temporary area into some object, the
<u>save-object</u>, provided by the run time system, and at <u>restore</u> the temporary area is
reestablished from this object.A garbage collection might be invoked from a routine (but
never from the outermost program level), thus the values of type OADDR and GADDR in
the save-objects must be accessible (to the run time system). (We will in this chapter call
the OADDR part of such values <u>pointers</u>.)</p>

<p>For the purpose of explanation we assume that the S-compiler keeps track of two
attributes of the temporary area, namely ALLOCATED which is the SIZE of the used part
of the temporary area at any given program point, and MARKS which identify all
intermediate values of type OADDR or GADDR. The former must be available during the
processing of <u>pushlen</u> (q.v.), while some representation of the latter must be transferred to
the save-object (at <u>save</u>).</p>

<p>The temp control instructions are used as follows: <u>t-inito</u> is called in preparation of a
complete scan through the pointers of a save-object. During the scan <u>t-geto</u> will be called
repeatedly, yielding the pointers successively. If the pointer is to be updated, one <u>t-seto</u>
will follow the corresponding <u>t-geto</u>, so that the pointer just inspected will be updated.</p>

&nbsp;
<h3>7.1.  <u>Implementation directives</u></h3>

<p>Since the contents of a save-object always will be accessed through one of the
instructions to be defined below (<u>t-inito</u>, <u>t-geto</u>, <u>t-seto</u>) the internal structure is completely
implementation- dependent. The reason is, that the access must be as fast as possible on
any given architecture, since the garbage collector makes several scans over the existing
save-objects during the mark and the move phases.</p>

&nbsp;
<h4>7.1.1.  <u>The save object</u></h4>

<p>Apart from the actual temporaries saved, some additional information must be present in
the save-objects. For the purpose of explanation we will call this additional attribute
SAVE-MARKS. SAVE-MARKS is some representation of the MARKS attribute to the
temporary area, which allows for sequential access to all pointer values saved. (E.g. a bit
map indicating the positions of the pointers in the save object, or an address to a
description of the save object, or a value giving the number of pointers, provided they are
stored consecutively in the save object, from a fixed offset.)</p>

<p>All of the temporary area must be included in the save object, except those values which
are constants. This includes non-pointers as well as pointers, and includes REF items as
well as VAL items. All REF items, all GADDR items and all OADDR items must be
delivered as pointers with <u>t-geto</u> unless they are known to be <u>onone</u> or <u>gnone</u>, or are
known to point within global variables, local variables or constants. Pointers that are
attributes of records must be returned unless they are in an alternate part of the record.
Note that the requirements that REF pointers must be returned implies that in general the
run time representation of a REF item must be the same as that of a GADDR.</p>

&nbsp;
<h4>7.1.2.  <u>Temp-control</u></h4>

<p>The parameters to the instructions <u>t-geto</u> and <u>t-seto</u> are implicit, i.e. they refer to the
save-object referenced by the most recent call (at run time) on <u>t-inito</u>, successive calls on
<u>t-geto</u> scans through the pointers in the save object, and a call on <u>t-seto</u> refers to the
pointer accessed by the most recent call on <u>t-geto</u>.</p>

<p>For the purpose of explanation we introduce two anonymous variables, SAVE-OBJECT
and SAVE-INDEX. SAVE-OBJECT is set by <u>t-inito</u> and referenced by <u>t-geto</u> and <u>t-seto</u>.
SAVE-INDEX is initialized by <u>t-inito</u>, updated by <u>t-geto</u> and referenced by <u>t-seto</u>. In an
implementation some representation of SAVE-OBJECT and SAVE-INDEX could be kept in
dedicated registers or in main storage. The use of the variables is explained in detail
below.</p>

&nbsp;
<h3>7.2.  <u>The occurrence of the protect construction</u></h3>

<p>The construction will occur in S-programs in the following context alone:</p>

<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="23%"><u>pushlen</u>				</td>
    <td width="77%">				( parameter to a run time      )</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="23%"><u>asscall</u>  &quot;profile:tag&quot;</td>
    <td width="77%">	( system routine, which returns)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="23%"><u>call</u>     &quot;body:tag&quot;</td>
    <td width="77%">		( the OADDR of a save-object   )</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="23%"><u>save</u></td>
    <td width="77%">&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="23%">	 ...</td>
    <td width="77%">
<p>	 ( some S-code sequence which will result in TOS describing an OADDR (mode REF), pointing to the object saved above )</p>

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="23%"><u>restore</u></td>
    <td width="77%">&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br WP="BR1"><br WP="BR2">
The protect instruction is illegal within routine bodies.
<p>The <u>pushlen</u> instruction will occur only in this context. Furthermore the object address
returned from the run time system before <u>restore</u> will point to the object generated at the
corresponding <u>save</u>. Observe that the object <u>address</u> is not necessarily the same since a
garbage collection may have occurred between <u>save</u> and <u>restore</u>.</p>

<br WP="BR1">
<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" colspan="2"><u>pushlen</u></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="6%">
      <p align="center"> *</td>
    <td width="94%">	push( VAL, SIZE, &quot;temporary area.LENGTH&quot; );</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="6%">&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="94%">
<p>	An implicit <u>eval</u> is performed.</p>

<p>	The SIZE needed for the following <u>save</u>, that is the sum of the current value of
ALLOCATED and the number of object units, which is needed for SAVE-MARKS
and possibly other implementation-dependant information, is computed and the
value is pushed onto the stack.</p>

<p>For optimisation purposes, it is set to <u>nosize</u> in case ALLOCATED = <u>nosize</u> (i.e. if the
temporary area is empty). In this case the accompaning <u>save</u> and corresponding <u>restore</u>
will receive <u>onone</u> as parameter.</p>

<p>	An S-compiler may choose to skip code generation for the complete sequence
<u>pushlen</u>, <u>asscall</u>, <u>call</u>, and <u>save</u> in the case ALLOCATED = <u>nosize</u>. In that case the
processing of <u>restore</u> is changed, see below.</p>
