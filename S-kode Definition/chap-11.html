<h2>11.  <strong>TRANSFER OF CONTROL</strong></h2>

<p>Branches in the executing program may be specified in several ways. The labels that
occur in the source program, correspond to the general labels treated in section 1. Some
source language constructions such as loops will generate branches, but at the
corresponding label it is known from where the branch came. Consequently a series of
instructions handle such specific labels, this is treated in section 2. Sections 3 and 4 treat
the <u>skip</u> and <u>if</u> statements respectively.</p>

&nbsp;
<h3>11.1.  <u>General labels</u></h3>

&nbsp;
<p>	label_declaration</p>

<p>		::=	label_specification  !  label_definition</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	label_specification</p>

<p>		::=	<u>labelspec</u>  label:newtag</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	label_definition</p>

<p>		::=	<u>label</u>  label:spectag</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	goto_instruction</p>

<p>		::=	<u>goto</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p>General labels permit unlimited transfer to program points outside routines, they
correspond to labels in the source program. Inside routine bodies general labels may not
be declared. The stack must be empty at <u>label</u> and after <u>goto</u>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>labelspec</u> label:newtag</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	An incomplete label descriptor is created, with no associated program point. The
program point must be defined later by a label definition.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>label</u>  label:spectag</p>

&nbsp;
<p> *	check stack empty;</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	If the label has been specified, the corresponding descriptor is modified to describe
the current program point. Otherwise a new descriptor is created of the form (VAL,
PADDR, &quot;current program point&quot;).</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>goto</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p> *	force TOS value;  check TOS type(PADDR);</p>

<p> *	pop;  check stack empty;</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	TOS is popped and instructions generated to perform the control transfer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>11.2.  <u>Specific labels</u></h3>

&nbsp;
<p>	jump_instruction</p>

<p>		::=	forward_jump	!  forward_destination</p>

<p>		::=	backward_jump	!  backward_destination</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	forward_jump</p>

<p>		::=	<u>switch</u>	switch:newtag  size:number</p>

<p>		::=	<u>fjumpif</u>	relation  destination:newindex</p>

<p>		::=	<u>fjump</u>	destination:newindex</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	forward_destination</p>

<p>		::=	<u>sdest</u>	switch:tag  which:number</p>

<p>		::=  <u>fdest</u>	destination:index</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	backward_jump</p>

<p>		::=  <u>bjump</u>	destination:index</p>

<p>		::=	<u>bjumpif</u>	relation  destination:index</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	backward_destination</p>

<p>		::=	<u>bdest</u>	destination:newindex</p>

&nbsp;
<p>Specific labels are generated as part of the translation process from the source program
into its S-code representation. Each instance of such a label may only be referenced
once, and this knowledge should simplify the label management in the S-compiler and
make it possible to optimise the code generated.</p>

<p>Such program points are not identified by tags or descriptors; they are accessed by
means of an &quot;index&quot;. An index may be either undefined (syntactically &quot;newindex&quot;), it may
refer to a particular program point (syntactically &quot;index&quot;).</p>

<p>The constructions described in this section do not have to be properly nested, i.e. the
destination of a forward jump may be located before or after the destination of a following
forward jump etc. But such jump-destination sets must be fully enclosed either in one
routine or in the main program.</p>

&nbsp;
<p>Examples:</p>

<p>             <u>switch</u>  SW  3</p>

<p>                   ...</p>

<p>            ?&gt; <u>sdest</u>  SW 0  ( two labels, because - )</p>

<p>               &gt; <u>bdest</u>  LL1   ( - two jumps to here   )</p>

<p>              !    ...</p>

<p>            ?!&gt; <u>sdest</u>  SW 1</p>

<p>              !    ...</p>

<p>                <u>bjump</u>  LL1</p>

<p>                   ...</p>

<p>            ?&gt; <u>sdest</u>  SW 2</p>

<br WP="BR1"><br WP="BR2">
<p>          &lt; <u>fjump</u>  LF1</p>

<p>                   ...</p>

<p>                   ...</p>

<p>           &gt; <u>bdest</u>  LB1</p>

<p>                  ...</p>

<p>              &lt; <u>fjump</u>  LF2</p>

<p>                 ...</p>

<p>         &gt; <u>fdest</u>  LF1</p>

<p>                  ...</p>

<p>             &lt;- <u>bjump</u>  LB1</p>

<p>                   ...</p>

<p>               &gt; <u>fdest</u>  LF2</p>

<br WP="BR1"><br WP="BR2">
<p><center>( observe that the jump-destination sets do not need</center>
</p>

<p><center>to be properly nested )</center>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>switch</u>  switch:newtag  size:number</p>

<br WP="BR1">
<p> *	force TOS value;  check TOS type(INT);</p>

<p> *	pop;</p>

<p> *	check stack empty;</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	The switch:newtag will be associated with a descriptor which identifies an ordered
set of &quot;size&quot; destinations &quot;D(0:size-1)&quot;, each of which must later be located by an
<u>sdest</u> instruction. The value described by TOS is used to generate a jump to the
required one, i.e. goto D(TOS). No range checking is implied, the necessary code
will have been generated by the front-end compiler.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>sdest</u>  switch:tag  which:number</p>

&nbsp;
<p> *	check stack empty;</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	The tag must have been defined in a <u>switch</u> instruction, and the number must be
within the range defined by the corresponding switch instruction, otherwise: error.</p>

<p>	The destination &quot;D(which)&quot; of the <u>switch</u> instruction defining the tag is located at the
current program point.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>fjumpif</u>  relation  destination:newindex  (dyadic)</p>

&nbsp;
<p> *	force TOS value; force SOS value;</p>

<p> *	check relation;</p>

<p> *	pop; pop;</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	The destination must be undefined, and TOS and SOS must be of the same
permissible resolved type with regard to the relation given, otherwise: error.</p>

<p>	A conditional forward jump sequence will be generated, branching only if the
relation (see chapter 9) evaluates <u>true</u>. The destination will refer to an undefined
program point to be located later (by <u>fdest</u>).</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>fjump</u>  destination:newindex</p>

&nbsp;
<p> *	check stack empty;</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	The destination must be undefined,otherwise: error.</p>

<p>	A jump to the (as yet unknown) program point is generated, and the destination
becomes defined.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>fdest</u>  destination:index</p>

&nbsp;
<p> *	check stack empty;</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	The destination must have been defined by a <u>fjump</u> or <u>fjumpif</u> instruction, otherwise:
error.</p>

<p>	The current program point becomes the destination of the jump-instruction and the
destination becomes undefined.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>bjumpif</u>  relation  destination:index (dyadic)</p>

&nbsp;
<p> *	force TOS value;   force SOS value;</p>

<p> *	check relation;</p>

<p> *	pop;  pop;</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	The destination must be defined by a <u>bdest</u> instruction, and TOS and SOS must be
of the same permissible resolved types with regard to relation, otherwise: error.</p>

<p>	A conditional jump sequence will be generated, branching only if the relation
evaluates <u>true</u>. The destination becomes undefined.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>bjump</u>  destination:index</p>

&nbsp;
<p> *	check stack empty;</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	The destination must have been defined in a <u>bdest</u> instruction, otherwise: error.</p>

<p>	A jump to the referenced program point is generated, and the destination becomes
undefined.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>bdest</u>  destination:newindex</p>

&nbsp;
<p> *	check stack empty;</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	The destination must be undefined, otherwise: error.</p>

<p>	The destination is defined to refer to the current program point.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>11.3.  <u>Skip statement</u></h3>

&nbsp;
<p>	skip_statement</p>

<p>		::=  <u>skipif</u>  relation  &lt;program_element&gt;*  <u>endskip</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p>	skip_instruction</p>

<p>		::=  <u>skipif</u>  relation  &lt;instruction&gt;*  <u>endskip</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p>The skip_statement is intended to be used where a transfer of control is to be generated
without altering the state of the stack, commonly to report error conditions during
expression evaluation. The skip <u>instruction</u> is the form the statement takes inside routine
bodies.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>skipif</u>  relation</p>

&nbsp;
<p> *	force TOS value;  force SOS value;</p>

<p> *	check relation;</p>

<p> *	pop;  pop;</p>

<p> *	save skip-stack;</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	The generated code will compute the relation, and control is transferred to an
&quot;end-label&quot; (to be defined later), if the relation is <u>true</u>. A copy of the complete state
of the S- compiler`s stack is saved as the &quot;skip-stack&quot;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>endskip</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p> *	check stack empty;   restore skip-stack;</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	If it is possible for control to reach the current program point, a call on a suitable
run time error routine must be inserted at the end of the generated skip-branch.
This will be the interrupt handler described in (4).</p>

<p>	The &quot;end-label&quot; is located at the current program point, and the &quot;skip-stack&quot; is
restored as the current stack.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>11.4.  <u>if-statement</u></h3>

&nbsp;
<p>	if_statement</p>

<p>		::=  <u>if</u>  relation  &lt;program_element&gt;*  else_part</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	else_part</p>

<p>		::=  <u>else</u>  &lt;program_element&gt;*  <u>endif</u>   !   <u>endif</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p>	if_instruction</p>

<p>		::=  <u>if</u>  relation  &lt;instruction&gt;*  i else_part</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	i else_part</p>

<p>		::=  <u>else</u>  &lt;instruction&gt;*  <u>endif</u>   !   <u>endif</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p>While the control transfer instructions covered in the preceding sections demand that the
stack be empty at the destination, this demand is relaxed in the usage of the constructions
defined here. In case the stack is non-empty at the point where different control branches
merge, the contents must be meaningful, that is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the stack depth must be the same in both merged branches, and</li>
  <li>the types of corresponding elements must be the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such merges take place only at <u>endif</u>.</p>

<p>To simplify the implementation of the if-construction we adopt the following restrictions:</p>

<p>The if-construction will end up with a mode value item on top of the stack while the rest of
the stack remains the same. This item is produced in one of two different ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The current TOS is modified in both if-branches.</li>
  <li>A new stack item of the same type is produced in each of the if-branches.</li>
</ul>
<p>A force TOS value is performed in both if-branches.</p>

<p>The statement will generate target code to be executed conditionally, i.e. if the condition
holds the if-part will be executed otherwise the elsepart (if any). It is comparable to very
simple if-statements in other languages. The if <u>instruction</u> is the restricted form this
construction takes inside routine bodies.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>if</u>  relation</p>

&nbsp;
<p> *	force TOS value;  force SOS value;</p>

<p> *	check relation;</p>

<p> *	pop;  pop;</p>

<p> *	remember stack as &quot;if-stack&quot;;</p>

&nbsp;
<p>The generated code will compute the value of the relation, and transfer control to an
&quot;else-label&quot; (to be defined later) if the relation is <u>false</u>. A copy of the complete state of the
S-compiler's stack is saved as the &quot;if-stack&quot;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>else</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p> *	force TOS value;</p>

<p> *	remember stack as &quot;else-stack&quot;;</p>

<p> *	reestablish stack saved as &quot;if-stack&quot;;</p>

&nbsp;
<p>An unconditional forward branch is generated to an &quot;end-label&quot; (to be defined later). A
copy is made of the complete state of the stack and this is saved as the &quot;else-stack&quot;, then
the stack is restored to the state saved as the &quot;if-stack&quot;. Finally the &quot;else-label&quot; (used by
<u>if</u>) is located at the current program point.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>endif</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p> *	force TOS value;</p>

<p> *	merge current stack with &quot;else-stack&quot; if it exists, otherwise &quot;if-stack&quot;;</p>

&nbsp;
<p>The current stack and the saved stack are merged. The saved stack will be the &quot;if-stack&quot; if
no else-part has been processed, otherwise it will be the &quot;else-stack&quot;. The merge takes
each corresponding pair of stack items and forces them to be identical by applying <u>fetch</u>
operations when necessary - this process will generally involve inserting code sequences
into the <u>if</u>-part and the <u>else</u>-part. It is an error if the two stacks do not contain the same
number of elements or if any pair of stack items cannot be made identical. After the merge
the saved stack is deleted.</p>

<p>If no else-part was processed the &quot;else-label&quot;, otherwise the &quot;end-label&quot;, is located at the
current program point.</p>
