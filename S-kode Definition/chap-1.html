<h2>1.  <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h2>

<p>In 1979 the Norwegian Computing Center (Oslo) and the Program Library Unit
(Edinburgh) initiated the &quot;S-PORT&quot; project: implementation of a portable SIMULA-system.
The system consists of three parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a portable front-end compiler,</li>
  <li>a portable run time support system, and</li>
  <li>a machine dependent code generator.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter includes the interfaces to the compile and run time environment.</p>

<p>The present report defines the intermediate language &quot;S-code&quot; used to transmit an
analyzed Simula program from the front end compiler to the code generator.</p>

<p>Both the front end compiler and the run time system will be distributed in S-code. In order
to implement Simula it will be necessary to program the code generator (the S-compiler)
for the machine in question. This compiler will take care of two tasks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it will produce code for the target machine corresponding to the S-program, and</li>
  <li>it will insert the necessary links to the operating system.</li>
</ul>
<p>This report is intended as an implementation independent definition, therefore the code
generation semantics are rather naive. A forthcoming report, &quot;S-compiler implementation
guide&quot;, will treat the implementation problems more in depth in view of our experience with
the S-PORT systems under way on HB DPS8, VAX, PR1ME, NORD 500 and Univac
1100.</p>

<p>The S-code has been designed by the authors. We acknowledge valuable criticism and
comment from Peter H&aring;ndlykken and H&aring;vard Hegna (NCC), who painstakingly read
through the draft of this report. Thanks are also due to Geoffrey E. Millard and Rob Pooley
(PLU), Georg P. Philippot (University of Oslo), Andras Gaspar and the rest of the team at
SZKI in Budapest, and Karel Babcicky and Birger M&oslash;ller Pedersen (NCC) for
contributions and ideas.</p>

<h3>

<br WP="BR1">1.2.  <u>Philosophy of the design</u></h3>
<p>It is important to realize, that S-code is not seen as a set of instructions which can be
executed (or interpreted) to perform the task specified by the source program. Instead
S-code controls a compilation process, the outcome of which is an executable form of the
program. Thus S-code comprises the instruction set of a <u>compiler</u>, not a (Simula)
<u>machine</u>.</p>

<p>S-code has been designed as a practical tool to facilitate the production of Simula
compilers on as wide a range of computers as possible. In addition the language makes it
possible to generate efficient object code, where &quot;efficient&quot; can mean different things
depending on the context: fast, compact, highly diagnostic, etc.</p>

<p>In order to achieve these aims the language had to be flexible enough to cater to these
needs. Unfortunately this flexibility forces a certain vagueness in the definition of the
S-code, making precise statements difficult and even dangerous as they may invalidate
styles of implementation for no better reason than that other possibilities were not
foreseen. Consequently this definition is only precise in terms of those parts of the
semantics which relate directly to the problems faced by the processor generating the
S-code.</p>

<p>It is appreciated that the task of producing an S-compiler is in many ways much simpler
than the task of maintaining such a compiler. The language has therefore been designed
so that errors in both the S-program and the S-compiler can be detected as close to the
point of error as possible.</p>

<p>To this end operations with far-reaching effects have been avoided as experience has
shown them to be excellent at covering up processing errors. A guiding principle adopted
is that it is better for the compiler to fail to compile a program (and inform the user of the
fact) than to purport to have compiled it but in reality to have generated faulty code. In the
former case there is no doubt as to where the problem lies (the compiler is wrong)
whereas in the latter vast amounts of time can be spent trying to find non-existent bugs in
user's programs.</p>

<p>In this report the language is presented using a conventional notation for the language
symbols as if S-programs were created as symbolic strings. This notation has been
chosen for publication purposes in order to make the report more readable. Actually all
S-programs will be byte encoded, i.e. a program will always be a string of (8-bit) bytes,
which encode the program according to the tables given in the appendix. No separating
spaces etc. are necessary, and will thus never occur.</p>

<h3>1.3.  <u>General overview</u></h3>

<p>A system programmed in S-code will in the general case consist of a main program, which
will receive control when the translated system is to begin execution, and several modules
which may provide type definitions, routine support (in the form of a run time system, as is
the case in S-PORT), etc.</p>

<p>Each program or module will contain three main classes of program elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>type definitions (<u>record</u> descriptors) govern the structure and manipulation of data
quantities,</li>
  <li>data quantity declarations (<u>const</u>, <u>local</u>) control the actual (static) allocation and
identification of data, and</li>
  <li>statements and instructions, possibly grouped in <u>routines</u>, specify (together with the
type information) the target machine instructions to be generated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike most assembly languages, S-code contains a number of structured statements
such as <u>if</u>-statement or <u>call</u>-statement. But unlike higher level languages (such as Simula)
any intermixture of the above elements is permitted, as long as a very few rules are
obeyed, the most significant being that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>	Any identifier (<u>tag</u>) must have been explicitly &quot;declared&quot; before it may be used in an
instruction.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Data to be manipulated may be of one of the usual types, such as integer, or the
information may be structured as a <u>record</u> with named (tagged) components, or even into
higher order structures such as linked lists or networks. Instructions (such as <u>add</u>) are
included for the massage of primitive data, while pointer- and structure- manipulating
instructions (such as <u>select</u> component) are included to support general graph traversion.</p>

<p>In principle S-code is a typed language, but type compatibility is enforced only upon the
simple types; usually no checking is implied when manipulating the representation of
instances of structured types, in particular no qualification check is implied on access to
record components. It is considered the responsibility of the S-code generators (e.g. the
front-end compiler) to ensure consistent use of pointers.</p>

<p>The main control structuring tool is the routine concept. A routine is inherently
non-recursive, all parameter transmissions are by value (but it is possible to transfer
pointer values), and strict syntax rules ensure that a routine will exit only through its final
end. Unlike other languages, S-code permits explicit naming of the location, in which the
return address is saved, so that a routine not necessarily returns to its point-of-call.</p>

<p>Routines also establish name hiding: all names (tags) defined within the routine are
invisible from the outside, they lose their meaning when the routine is left. As a matter of
fact they may be reused in other routines or even at a later point in the enclosing program,
for quite different purposes.</p>

<p>A module defines a closed name scope (just like routines), it is however possible to
selectively open the scope, making certain aspects of a module accessible outwith the
module, while other aspects remain hidden. Type definitions, routine identifications,
labels, and named constants can be made visible in this manner.</p>

<p>The <u>interface</u> <u>module</u> specifies the assumptions made about the environment, in which the
translated program is to be executed. This special module also serves as a global area for
variables and constants.</p>

<h3>1.5.  <u>Description of syntax rules</u></h3>

<p>The S-code syntax is described in BNF with the following additions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Meta symbols are written in lower case without brackets, terminal symbols are
underlined lower case, and upper case is used for pre- defined tags.</li>
  <li>Alternative right hand sides for a production may be separated by ::= as well as !.</li>
  <li>Productions may be annotated with comments enclosed in parentheses.</li>
  <li>Part of a right hand side may be enclosed in angular brackets followed by one of
the characters ?, *, or + with the following meanings:
    <ul>
      <li>	&lt; symbol string &gt;?	( &quot;symbol string&quot; is optional; it may occur zero times or once. )</li>
      <li>	&lt; symbol string &gt;*	( &quot;symbol string&quot; may occur zero or more times at this point. )</li>
      <li>	&lt; symbol string &gt;+	( &quot;symbol string&quot; must occur one or more times at this point. )</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Spaces and line breaks are used simply to separate various parts of a production;
they have no other significance, in particular they will not occur in the S-program.</li>
  <li>Particular instances of a meta-symbol may be given a prefix, separated from the
symbol by a colon, e.g. body:tag. The prefix (body) has the sole purpose of
identifying the meta-symbol (tag) in the accompanying description; it has no
syntactical significance whatsoever.</li>
