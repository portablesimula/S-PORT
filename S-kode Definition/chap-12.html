<h2>12.  <strong>SEGMENTATION CONTROL</strong></h2>

&nbsp;
<p>	segment_instruction</p>

<p>		::=  <u>bseg</u>  &lt;program_element&gt;*  <u>eseg</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p>This instruction specifies that the enclosed program elements are out of sequence, i.e. the
code generated must either be located elsewhere or it must be preceded by an
unconditional jump instruction leading to the program point following <u>eseg</u>. The segment
instruction is illegal within routine bodies.</p>

<p>The purpose of the segment instruction is to be able to generate e.g. code for a &quot;thunk&quot; in
the natural S-program context, without having to worry about whether to generate jumps
around it etc. The intention is that the enclosed elements from the point of view of a
sequential scan through the surrounding code should be completely invisible, i.e. the
following piece of S-code:</p>

&nbsp;
<p>		sequence-1  <u>bseg</u>  sequence-2  <u>eseg</u>  sequence-3</p>

&nbsp;
<p>will generate target code for sequence-1 and sequence-3 in direct control sequence while
sequence-2 will be located somewhere that is unreachable except through an explicit
transfer of control (goto or the like).</p>

<p>Note that all jump/destination sets must be fully enclosed within a segment.</p>

<p>An S-program will contain many such segment constructions. The S-compiler has
complete freedom to decide <u>where</u> to locate the corresponding enclosed program
segments.</p>

<p>The segment construction has no implied effect on the allocation of data or constants.</p>

<p>The <u>bseg</u> and <u>eseg</u> have similar effects on the stack as <u>save</u> and <u>restore</u> (chapter 7).</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>bseg</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p> *	remember stack;</p>

<p> *	purge stack;</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	The current program point is remembered together with the complete state of the
stack, the &quot;bseg-stack&quot;. Some new segment is designated the current program
point, together with a new, empty stack.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><u>eseg</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p> *	check stack empty;</p>

<p> *	reestablish stack remembered at corresponding <u>bseg</u>;</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	If it is possible for control to reach the current program point, a call on a suitable
run time error routine must be inserted at the end of the generated program
segment. This will be the interrupt_handler routine described in (4).</p>

<p>	The &quot;bseg-stack&quot; is restored together with the saved program point.</p>
