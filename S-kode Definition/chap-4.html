<br WP="BR1"><br WP="BR2">
<br WP="BR1">Any data quantity must belong to some <u>type</u>. The type will define the internal structure of
the quantity as well as the operations that may be performed upon it. Types are used as
generators in global, constant, local or parameter definitions and as specificators in
quantity descriptors. Each type defines a descriptor (of the same type), this descriptor
cannot be used on the stack, thus types cannot be used dynamically as e.g. parameters.
<p>The distinction between resolved and non-resolved type is made because of the indefinite
repetition, which may occur in structured types. Such a type cannot be used as a
generator, or in further type definition, without determining the actual number of elements
in the repetition.</p>

<p>Whenever the S-compiler should perform type checking, neither the actual number of
elements in such an indefinite repetition, nor the actual range specified for an INT quantity
is of any significance, unless it is explicitly indicated in the text. A structured type can be
extended by using prefixing. Such two types are not type compatible (but note that the
S-code only imposes type checking in a very few cases such as in initialisation of
globals).</p>

4..1..2.  <u>Data address types</u></h4>

<p>Addresses in S-code are designed to permit the description of objects which are arranged
in implementation and machine-dependent ways. In particular it is envisaged that some
S-compilers may pack information into available storage in ways which require to be
described using complex addresses. These considerations have led to the following types

<h3>4.2.  <u>Quantity descriptors</u></h3>

<br WP="BR1">
<p>	quantity_descriptor</p>

<p>		::=	resolved_type &lt; Rep count:number &gt;?</p>

<br WP="BR1">Any quantity in the S-program is described by a quantity descriptor. The type will define
the internal structure of the quantity as well as the set of operations permitted.
<p><br WP="BR2">
<h4>4.2.1.  <u>Subrange of INT (range, SINT)</u></h4>

<p>Quantities of type INT may be restricted in range, as shown. A range has a contiguous
value domain which is part of the domain for INT.</p>

<p>The motivation for range is storage economy for variables with a restricted value domain.
Ranges are used extensively in the S-port run-time system, e.g. for some of the system
attributes present in all user-defined objects.</p>

<p>The S-compiler allocates a range to a storage unit which at least comprises the closed
interval (lower..upper) specified for the range. The value domain of a range is system
dependant and defined to be the domain of the storage unit allocated to the range.</p>

<p>The type SINT corresponds to the type of variables declared <u>short</u> <u>integer</u> in a Simula
program. The S-compiler treats SINT as a range specified with a suitable interval, at least
including (-32000,32000), and (almost) symmetrical around zero.</p>

<p>Although ranges occur in arithmetic S-code expressions, there is no arithmetic operations
(or relations) defined on ranges. It is the responsibility of the S-compiler to convert to INT
before the operation is performed, and to convert to range before assignment to a range.
(This scheme is consistent with the Common Base specification of <u>short</u> <u>integer</u> which
states that all operations on <u>short</u> <u>integer</u> should be performed in full integer arithmetic.)</p>

<p>One consequence of this is that intermediate results (see chapter 7) never can be range
restricted.</p>

<p>It is required that the S-compiler checks domain overflow for assignment to ranges
originating from SINTs, while such a check is not required for other ranges, e.g. ranges
declared in the run-time system. The S-compiler may choose to always generate domain
checks on assignment, hence treating any range as it must treat SINT.</p>

<p>The predefined range SINT is the only possible tagged quantity descriptor.</p>

&nbsp;
<h4>4.2.2.  <u>Repetitions (rep)</u></h4>

<p>A quantity may be defined as a repetition. If the count:number is greater than zero a
vector of identical elements is defined, containing that number of elements and accessed
through indexing (see <u>index</u>, chapter 6) with indices starting at zero. The allocation of the
elements must be done in such a way that the size of each element provides enough
information to permit access to one relative to another. A count of zero indicates that the
number of elements is indefinite. Such indefinite repetitions are only permitted in record
descriptors.</p>

<p>It is important to realise that the repetition concept does not impose any structure upon
the quantity (as e.g. an array declaration does). Whenever a repeated quantity is selected
(by <u>push</u>, <u>select</u>, or <u>remote</u>) the first element is selected directly.</p>

&nbsp;
<h3>4.3.  <u>Type definition</u></h3>

&nbsp;
<p>	record_descriptor</p>

<p>		::=	<u>record</u> record_tag:newtag &lt;record_info&gt;?</p>

<p>			&lt;prefix_part&gt;? common_part</p>

<p>			&lt;alternate_part&gt;* <u>endrecord</u></p>

<br WP="BR1">
<p>	record_info</p>

<p>		::=	<u>info</u> &quot;TYPE&quot;  !  <u>info</u> &quot;DYNAMIC&quot;</p>

<br WP="BR1">
<p>	prefix_part</p>

<p>		::=	<u>prefix</u>  resolved_structure</p>

<br WP="BR1">
<p>	common_part</p>

<p>		::=	&lt;attribute_definition&gt;*</p>

<br WP="BR2">
<p>	alternate_part</p>

<p>		::=	<u>alt</u>  &lt;attribute_definition&gt;*</p>

<br WP="BR1">
<p>	attribute_definition</p>

<p>		::=	<u>attr</u> attr:newtag quantity_descriptor</p>

<br WP="BR1">
<p>	resolved_structure</p>

<p>		::=	structured_type  &lt; <u>fixrep</u>  count:ordinal &gt;?</p>

<br WP="BR1"><br WP="BR2">
<p>	structured_type</p>

<p>		::=	record_tag:tag</p>

<br WP="BR1"><br WP="BR2">
A record descriptor defines a structured type with the tag 'record tag'. This new type may
then later be used either as a generator in variable or constant definitions, as a prefix or
as an attribute type in further record descriptors; in all these cases an indefinite repetition
must be resolved through the use of <u>fixrep</u>. Or the record tag may be used as a parameter
to some instructions, in which case an indefinite repetition need not be so resolved.
<p>  A set of incomplete type descriptors  will be associated with the record tag:newtag.
These descriptors may be divided into several subsets: one describing part of the type
with a fixed interpretation and the remainder describing a number of interpretations for the
rest of the type. The SIZE of the structure will be the SIZE of the prefix plus the SIZE of
the common part plus the SIZE of the &quot;largest&quot; alternative, that is the alternative
occupying the largest number of object units (disregarding a possible indefinite repetition).
Which of several alternatives determines the SIZE is implementation dependent.</p>

&nbsp;
<h4>4.3.1.  <u>Prefixing</u></h4>

&nbsp;
<p>If specified, the prefix must refer to a defined type descriptor, resulting in a type which is
the prefix type extended by the specified attributes (an indefinite repetition in the prefix
type must be resolved).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>4.3.2.  <u>Attributes</u></h4>

<p>Each attribute definition defines the type of an accessible attribute of the structure. There
is no inherent correspondence between the order of the attributes in the record descriptor
and the allocation order inside a record, but when the record descriptor is processed by
the S-compiler, an AADDR value will be associated with each attribute tag defined. These
associations cannot later be changed, which implies that the order prefix...common part
must be preserved.</p>

&nbsp;
<h4>4.3.3.  <u>Indefinite repetitions and fixrep</u></h4>

<p>An indefinite repetition in the record descriptor must be the (lexically) very last attribute
defined, i.e. it occurs immediately before <u>endrecord</u>. The type so defined cannot generally
be used (except in a few instructions) without being resolved through the application of
the <u>fixrep</u> construction; this will determine the actual number of elements in the repetition.
Note however that type compatibility checking is connected to the record tag, so that
structures are of the same type even if they are resolved with different counts.</p>

&nbsp;
<h4>4.3.4.  <u>Alternatives (records with variants)</u></h4>

<p>If several alternate parts are given, it specifies alternative interpretations of the same
area, the correspondence between pairs of attributes from different alternatives is not
defined. The alternate part(s) must be allocated following the common part.</p>

&nbsp;
<h4>4.3.5.  <u>Allocation order</u></h4>

<p>The S-compiler is free to reorder or pack the attributes in any convenient way, as long as
the above mentioned restrictions are observed, in summary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the order prefix...common part...alternatives must be preserved,</li>
  <li>once ordered and packed the order is invariant, that is a prefix cannot be
re-packed,</li>
  <li>an indefinite repetition must be allocated at the end of the structure,</li>
  <li>records are always allocated with a size corresponding to the largest alternative (at
allocation an indefinite repetition cannot occur).</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<p>Examples:		<u>record</u>  COMPLEX</p>

<p>				<u>attr</u>  RE  REAL  <u>attr</u>  IM  REAL</p>

<p>			<u>endrecord</u></p>

<p>			<u>record</u>  C</p>

<p>				<u>attr</u>  D  BOOL</p>

<p>				<u>attr</u>  E  COMPLEX  <u>rep</u>  2</p>

<p>			<u>endrecord</u></p>

<p>			<u>record</u>  F  <u>prefix</u>  C</p>

<p>				<u>alt</u> <u>attr</u>  G  REAL</p>

<p>				<u>alt</u> <u>attr</u>  H  PADDR</p>

<p>				<u>alt</u> <u>attr</u>  J  BOOL  <u>rep</u>  0</p>

<p>			<u>endrecord</u></p>

<br WP="BR1">The type F will have the common part as defined by C, and three alternative parts; one
contains an indefinite repetition. The indefinite repetition 'J' must be resolved whenever F
is used either in a record descriptor or as a generator for allocation.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>4.3.6.  <u>Record information</u></h4>

<p>The record info string is used to give information to the S-Compiler on the use of certain
records. Three classes of records are distinguished, any record descriptor will be in one of
these classes:</p>

<ul>
  <li> -	All structured types which may occur as TYPE in value mode stack descriptors
shall contain the record <u>info</u> &quot;TYPE&quot;. This may be usefull when processing the
protect construction.</li>
  <li> -	A small set of structured types are used as prefixes to every dynamic quantity
created by the run time system during execution; such types shall contain  <u>info</u>
&quot;DYNAMIC&quot;. This information may be necessary in order to determine the size,
since the target system may prohibit general use of the address space for such
objects, e.g. dynamic reference should be to an even byte address).<br>
	<u>dsize</u> is valid only for types in this set.</li>
  <li> -	If a record descriptor does not contain (either directly or through a prefix) any such
specification, the record will not be used for any of the two above mentioned
purposes.<br>
	It may not be necessary for the S-compiler to utilise the record information field; in
that case the specifications may be ignored and no distinction should be made by
the compiler.</li>
</ul>

constant.TYPE, ...). In case it is necessary to refer to a tagged constant before it is
possible to give its value, the constant specification is used to bind the tag to a value of
the given type. This constant must be given a value later in the program through a
constant definition, and the types must be the same.</p>

<p>A constant is always allocated an integral number of object units.</p>
