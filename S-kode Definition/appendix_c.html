</p>

<br WP="BR1">
<h4>Article 1. <u>Definitions</u></h4>

<p>The Portable SIMULA System (PSS) consists of a language dependent part and a target
dependent part. The interface between these two parts is at any time defined in the
documents:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>	S-PORT: Definition of S-code</p>

<p>	S-PORT: The Environment Interface</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The two documents comprise the PSS interface definition.</p>

<p>An S-compiler system is a system which is able to translate and execute programs
represented according to the PSS interface definition.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Article 2. <u>Objectives</u></h4>

<p>The Standards Group for the Portable SIMULA System (SG/PSS) is an organisation which
at all times shall:</p>

<ul>
  <li>be the final arbiter in the interpretation of the PSS interface definition and be
a center for custody of this formal definition.</li>
  <li>provide a forum for discussion and exchange of information relating to the
PSS interface definition and its support.</li>
  <li>standardise the PSS interface definition and modify the definition when this
is found necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Article 3. <u>Membership</u></h4>

<p>Membership is open to organisations and firms responsible for the maintenance and
support of an S-compiler system in active use. Any organisation may apply and be voted a
member of the SG/PSS.</p>

<p>The Norwegian Computing Center (NCC), Oslo, Norway and the Edinburgh Regional
Computing Center (ERCC), Edinburgh, Scotland are ex officio members of the SG/PSS.
The NCC will also act as the secretariat of the SG/PSS.</p>

<p>The SG/PSS can offer membership to individuals, in recognition of their contribution to the
SG/PSS work.</p>

<p>Once granted, an SG/PSS membership lasts until:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is resigned by the member, or</li>
  <li>it is revoked by the SG/PSS because the conditions under which it was
granted cease to exist or the member acts against the objectives of the
SG/PSS.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no membership fee for the SG/PSS. Members must cover their own
expences.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Article 4. <u>Representation, Voting and Meetings</u></h4>

<p>Each member shall appoint one person to be his/her representative in the SG/PSS. The
duration of appointment is determined by the members.</p>

<p>The SG/PSS shall meet once every year for an Annual Meeting. This meeting will, in
addition to possible administrative matters, handle proposals related to the PSS interface
definition. The Annual Meeting shall also elect one of the member's representatives as
Chairman for the Standards Group.</p>

<p>Decisions can only be taken regarding matters on the agenda presented to the members
at least 3 weeks before the meeting, unless all members present agree otherwise.</p>

<p>In addition to the Annual Meeting SG/PSS may have extraordinary meetings. Such
meetings are held when the Chairman finds it necessary, or when this is approved by a
majority of the members.</p>

<p>To constitute a quorum, all members of the SG/PSS shall be notified of the meeting and a
majority of the members representatives shall be present or give their votes by mail,
including the NCC and ERCC representatives.</p>

<p>Decisions by SG/PSS are made by a majority vote among the representatives taking part
in the vote. Changes to the statutes for the SG/PSS or a decision to dissolve the SG/PSS
require 4/5 majority. Any decision requires the consent of the NCC.</p>

<p>The SG/PSS meetings are open to non-representatives or non-members. Observers have
no voting rights, and must apply to the Chairman of the SG/PSS for each meeting they
wish to attend.</p>

&nbsp;
<h4>Article 5. <u>Effectuation and revisions</u></h4>

<p>These statutes were adopted at the Foundation Meeting of the Standards Group for the
Portable SIMULA System in Edinburgh the 3rd March 1981 and come into effect
immediately.</p>

&nbsp;
<h3><u>Formal rules of the SG/PSS operation</u></h3>

&nbsp;
<p>1.	The main task of the SG/PSS is the maintenance of the PSS interface definition. Its
work consists of:</p>

<ol type="a">
  <li>a clarification of obscure parts of the definition.</li>
  <li>removal of eventual conflicts in the definition.</li>
  <li>alteration of the definition when necessary.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<p>2.	The following types of changes in the definition can be directly considered by
SG/PSS:</p>

<ol type="a">
  <li>obvious oversights that have occurred in the text of the definition.</li>
  <li>removal of language restrictions that are proved obsolete for consistency
and implementation.</li>
  <li>trivial extensions to the existing concepts that are felt relevant for continued
use of the definition in changing environments.</li>
  <li>any other changes as long as none of the members are against it.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.	Any other changes than those mentioned in point 2 above can also be considered.
These changes must, however, be submitted to the secretariat two (2) months prior
to the meeting. Submitted proposals will be distributed to the members without
delay, to facilitate inclusion of relevant comments in the material presented with the
meeting agenda at least three (3) weeks before said meeting.</p>

&nbsp;
<p>4.	All proposals for changes in the PSS interface definition conforming with the above
rules must be formulated in writing in a concise manner and submitted to the
secretariat. Anyone may submit such a proposal.</p>

&nbsp;
<p>5.	The Chairman of the SG/PSS is responsible for confirming receipt of each
proposal, registering it and scheduling its processing at one of the meetings of the
SG/PSS. Alternatively the Chairman may point out any inadequacies in a proposal
to its submitter.</p>

<p>	The proposal will be announced at the subsequent SG/PSS meeting which may
approve or revoke the Chairman's decision related to this proposal.</p>

<p>	Complete material related to a proposal will be submitted to the members when the
proposal is processed at the next meeting or by specific request.</p>

&nbsp;
<p>6.	In its final form every proposal will be an updating text to one of the documents
comprising the PSS interface definition. It will further indicate the original submitter,
date of submission and its motivation. Alternative forms of the proposal and
reasons for their rejection are a valuable part of the document. An example of a
suitable form is attached to these rules.</p>

<p>	The logical consistency of the text, its clarity and conciseness are of utmost
importance. To this end the SG/PSS or its Chairman may allocate one particular
member to bring the proposal into the required shape if this is deemed necessary.</p>

&nbsp;
<p>7.	It is the responsability of the Chairman to notify the submitter of a proposal about
the result of its processing by the SG/PSS if this is not otherwise obvious. It is also
his/her responsibility to minimize the time taken over each proposal.</p>

&nbsp;
<p>8.	The final text of the proposals will be available from the secratariat as a
supplement to the PSS interface definition until they are incorporated into the
definition at the next revision of the documents. To facilitate this process, at its
approval a proposal will be assigned a number reflecting which of the documents it
refers to and its chronological order.</p>
