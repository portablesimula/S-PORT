<h2>16.  <strong>OTHER INSTRUCTIONS</strong></h2>

&nbsp;
<p>	eval_instruction</p>

<p>		::=	<u>eval</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p>In certain cases the code specified by previuos program elements must be generated in
order to ensure, that the generated program will behave correctly. As an example,
consider the following SIMULA statement:</p>

&nbsp;
<p>			x.b  :=  a + f;</p>

&nbsp;
<p>where &quot;f&quot; is a function that, as a side effect, may change both &quot;a&quot; and &quot;x&quot;.</p>

<p>However, the semantics of SIMULA demands strict left-to-right evaluation of statement
components. The actual values to be used in the execution of the translated statement
<u>must</u> be the values before the function f is executed. Thus it is necessary that the values
of x and a used in the computation really are &quot;fetched&quot; into some temporary locations. A
possible optimisation might instead remember that these values are stored in specific
locations, and use these values directly from the locations &quot;x&quot; and &quot;a&quot;. In that case the
computed result would be wrong. In such a situation the front end compiler will issue this
instruction.</p>

<p>The instruction forces the S-compiler to perform any operations previously specified in the
S-program, which may have been deferred for optimisation purposes. All values and
references must be fully evaluated and stored in the temporary area when an <u>eval</u> is
done, unless they are constants. Following the instruction the internal state of the
S-compiler must match the state implied by a strict application of the S-code definition.</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	delete_statement</p>

<p>		::=	<u>delete</u>  from:tag</p>

&nbsp;
<p>   * check stacks empty;</p>

&nbsp;
<p>All tags defined with values greater than or equal to from:tag are made undefined, i.e. the
corresponding descriptors may be released. The tags become available for reuse. The
stack and all saved stacks must be empty, otherwise: error.</p>

<p>The S-code generators (e.g. the SIMULA front-end compiler) will ensure that the following
rules are obeyed; since it may be very costly in terms of execution time for the S-compiler
to check these conditions, we recommend the use of an internal switch to govern such
consistency checks.</p>

<p>Let DEL be the set of tags to be deleted (i.e. the set of tags in the closed interval
from...largest defined tag). The following conditions apply to elements of DEL:</p>

&nbsp;
<p> a)	If a record tag is in DEL, then</p>
<ul>
  <li>all quantities having this record as type,</li>
  <li>all records having this record as prefix, and</li>
  <li>all attributes of this record</li>
</ul>
<p>	are in DEL.</p>
<p> b)	If an attribute tag is in DEL, then</p>
<ul>
  <li>the associated record tag is in DEL.</li>
</ul>
<p>c)	If a profile tag is in DEL, then</p>
<ul>
  <li>all body tags associated with this profile</li>
  <li>all parameter tags of this profile</li>
</ul>
<p>	are in DEL.</p>
<p> d)	If a parameter tag is in DEL, then</p>
<ul>
  <li>the associated profile tag is in DEL.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<p>These conditions may be summarised informally as follows: Once a tag is to be deleted,
all tags which directly or indirectly refer to this tag are deleted in the same delete
statement.</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	info_setting</p>

<p>		::=	<u>decl</u> line:number</p>

<p>		::=	<u>line</u> line:number</p>

<p>		::=	<u>stmt</u> line:number</p>

<p>		::=	<u>info</u>  string</p>

<p>		::=	<u>setswitch</u>  switch:byte  setting:byte</p>

&nbsp;
<p>The <u>line</u>, <u>decl</u> and <u>stmt</u> instructions are used to inform about a mapping between a source
program and its S-Code. The argument of the instructions refer to the numbering of the
lines of the program listing from the S-Code producer. <u>decl</u> informs that the code following
is for a SIMULA declaration starting on the line with the supplied number. <u>stmt</u> informs
that the code following is for a SIMULA statement starting on the line with the supplied
number. <u>line</u> informs that the current point in the S-Code corresponds to the start of the
source program line with the given number. The intention is that the Front End Compiler
will produce <u>decl</u> and <u>stmt</u> instructions, while <u>line</u> instructions will occur in the code for the
Run-Time System.</p>

<p>Eventually these instructions should be used to produce a mapping between the original
source program and its corresponding machine-code. For this purpose none of them need
occur in the final machine-code. The mapping may be represented by for instance a table.</p>

<p>The <u>stmt</u> instruction may be used for another purpose as well, see chapter 11 of The
Environment Interface.</p>

<p><u>info</u> offers the possibility to communicate to the S-compiler information, which must be
interpreted in a system-dependent manner.</p>

<p><u>setswitch</u> is intended to control various aspects of the working of the S-compiler such as
the production of debugging information.</p>

<p>The compiler will maintain a set of switches which can be set to various values:
SWITCH(switch) := setting. The meanings of the switches and their settings will be
implementation-dependent with the following exceptions:</p>

&nbsp;
<ol type="a">
  <li>SWITCH(1) controls the listing of the S-code as it is processed by the compiler.
Such listing should be done using the mnemonics defined in this document
(underline excepted).<br>
	SWITCH(2) controls the stack activity trace.</li>
  <li>The setting to zero of a switch inhibits the actions controlled by the switch. This
should be the default setting of all switches.</li>
</ol>
