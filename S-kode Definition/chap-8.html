<h2>8.  <strong>DYNAMIC QUANTITIES</strong></h2>

&nbsp;
<p>	access_instruction</p>

<p>		::=	<u>setobj</u>	!  <u>getobj</u></p>

<p>		::=	<u>access</u>  oindex:byte  attribute:tag</p>

<p>		::=	<u>accessv</u>  oindex:byte  attribute:tag</p>

<br WP="BR1"><br WP="BR2">
The addressing of dynamic quantities poses a problem as their descriptors are
incomplete. Dynamic quantities are continually being created and destroyed during
program execution, and the S-compiler is not in control of their creation and allocation in
storage; this task is the responsibility of the run time system.
<p>In order to complete the definition of descriptors of dynamic objects the S-compiler must
provide a mechanism for associating object addresses (to be generated at run time) with
natural numbers or object indices known at compile time. The access instructions
described below manipulate such associations.</p>

<p>The scheme adopted should give complete freedom to the S-compiler in choosing an
appropriate implementation strategy; this can have a considerable effect on run-time
performance. The upper bound on the indices is implementation-defined, but it must be
greater than 7.</p>

<p>A well-known implementation technique using a &quot;display vector&quot; being continually updated
during program execution is for instance catered for in this proposal; as a matter of fact
that is the reason why the numbers associated with the objects are called &quot;object indices&quot;.</p>
