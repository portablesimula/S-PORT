<h2>2.  <strong>DESCRIPTORS AND THE COMPILE TIME STACK</strong></h2>

<p>The actions, which the S-compiler should take upon recognition of a specific program
element, are defined in terms of <u>descriptors</u>. These actions will in general involve both the
manipulation of descriptors and code generation for the target machine. Exactly <u>when</u>
such code generation should take place, as well as the generation <u>order</u>, is to a wide
extent left to the S-compiler to decide. However, at certain points in the program code
generation <u>must</u> take place. Such points are either implicit in the evaluation of certain
instructions, or they will be marked explicitly by the <u>eval</u> instruction (see chapter 16).</p>

<p>The descriptors contain information about various objects which will exist during the
computation. The descriptors themselves do not exist at run time; they are compile-time
objects used to control the generation of executable code. The exact form of descriptors
(and other data structures maintained during the compilation process) depends on both
the target machine and the implementation techniques, but for the purpose of explanation
we will assume that descriptors will contain at least three fields: MODE, TYPE, and
&quot;value&quot;.</p>

<p>Once a descriptor has been defined it remains unaltered, but the tagged descriptors are
used to create and modify anonymous descriptors held in a <u>stack</u>. This stack need not
have any existence in the compiled program, it is purely a device for describing the effect
of the S-instructions. At run time intermediate results will exist; such &quot;temporaries&quot; are
related to the state of the compile-time stack. In practice the stack will never be very deep,
a limit of about fifty descriptors should prove to be over-generous.</p>

<h3>2.1.  <u>The &quot;value&quot; field (BASE, OFFSET)</u></h3>

<p>This field may hold an address or a value - or even a specification of a computation that
will lead to either - depending upon the MODE field. For the purpose of explanation we
will adopt the very naive view that this field always contains either an address description
or a value. In the former case (when MODE is REF) we will consider this field to comprise
two subfields, referred to as BASE and OFFSET; they will contain descriptors of the
OADDR and the AADDR components of a general address respectively. Generally the
&quot;value&quot; field will be described in very loose terms.</p>

<h3>2.2.  <u>MODE, the access control field</u></h3>

<p>The MODE is an implementation-dependent specification of an algorithm or &quot;access rule&quot;
which, when applied to the rest of the descriptor, will yield the described quantity. Clearly,
as these access rules will vary from compiler to compiler it is impossible to give a rigorous
definition of them. However from the point of view of describing the effect of certain
S-code constructions, access rules can be grouped into two general modes, namely VAL
and REF.</p>

<table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="8%" valign="top">VAL</td>
    <td width="92%">
  <df>VAL access rules describe <u>values</u>. In this case the &quot;value&quot; field may or may not
contain the actual value described. A descriptor with MODE VAL could specify that
a value is
<ul>
<li>the constant 137</li>
<li>contained in register 4</li>
<li>the address of label LAB1</li>
<li>contained in area X</li>
<li>or it could specify an algorithm for obtaining the value, such as &quot;add the
value in area X to index register 6&quot; etc.</li>
</ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="8%" valign="top">REF&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="92%">
<p>	REF access rules describe references to areas which have an associated address
of some sort. In this case the &quot;value&quot; field may or may not hold this address. A
descriptor of MODE REF could specify that an area is</p>

      <ul>
        <li>	pointed at by index register 2</li>
        <li>	pointed at by the area X</li>
        <li>	starting at bit 5 of the area 300</li>
        <li>	at the address: displacement + (base)</li>
        <li>	at the address: (display(5)) + offset</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The main significance of this distinction may be stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>	An assignment of a quantity described by &quot;descr1&quot; to a quantity described by
&quot;descr2&quot; is not valid if descr2 do not have mode REF. The descriptor descr1 may
be of either mode, if it is REF, it is converted to VAL first.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3>2.3.  <u>TYPE, the data item type</u></h3>

<p>TYPE specifies the values that may be associated with the object described, and hence
also defines the interpretations of operations upon that object; the instruction <u>add</u> may
operate on integers or reals, and depending on the actual type either a real (floating point)
add or an integer add machine instruction may be generated.</p>

<p>Within a descriptor the TYPE field holds the tag of a descriptor defining the type. The
simple types refer to pre-defined descriptors, while structured types refer to record
descriptors. The descriptors referred to by TYPE have TYPE fields referring to themselves.
The TYPEs manipulated by S-code may be grouped as follows:</p>

<table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="14%" valign="top">VOID&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="86%">	This type is used to restrict the operations on certain descriptors. The only general
operation permitted is <u>pop</u>, but other operations are defined on specific classes of
descriptors of type VOID. VOID is <u>not</u> a type of S-code, purely a convenient
specification for certain descriptors.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="14%" valign="top">simple type</td>
    <td width="86%">		The simple types are BOOL, CHAR, INT, REAL, LREAL, SIZE,
      AADDR, OADDR, GADDR, PADDR, and RADDR, and are described in section 4.1.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="14%" valign="top">structuredtypes</td>
    <td width="86%">		refer to type tags defined by record descriptors, see section 4.3.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
&nbsp;
<h3>2.4.  <u>Reference to descriptors (tags)</u></h3>

<p>During the compilation descriptors will be created and destroyed. With the exception of
stack items each descriptor is associated on creation with a unique identifying &quot;tag&quot;, on
destruction the tag becomes available for re-use.</p>

<p>In this document tags will be used in a manner similar to the use of identifiers in other
languages, that is they will represent either a particular descriptor or the object described
by that descriptor. In the hardware representation of S-code the tags will be positive
numbers.</p>

<p>Syntactically a distinction is made between &quot;tag&quot;, &quot;newtag&quot;, and &quot;spectag&quot;. Whenever
&quot;tag&quot; occurs the corresponding value must be defined, that is associated with a descriptor.
&quot;newtag&quot; signifies that the tag value is undefined, that is it has either never
occurred previously in the program text, or the meaning has been (explicitly or implicitly) deleted. In
the case of &quot;spectag&quot;, the tag value may either be undefined, otherwise it must have
occurred previously in a specification of a routine, a constant, or a label.</p>

<h3>2.5.  <u>Stack semantics</u></h3>

<p>The effect of instructions upon the items in the stack is described using a procedural
notation, and marked with asterisks in the left margin. The following terms are used with a
specific meaning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the term &quot;error&quot; means that the compilation should be abandoned with a minimum
of change to the controlling environment. A suitable error message should be
generated.</li>
  <li>&quot;check ...&quot; (e.g. check TOS ref;) means that if the condition is not fulfilled (in the
example: if TOS is not mode REF) the S-program is in error (see above).</li>
  <li>The top elements of the stack will be referred to as TOS (top of stack) and SOS
(second on stack). If any instruction refers to a non-existing item on the stack, the
S-program is in error.</li>
  <li>	<u>TOS</u> and <u>SOS</u> (underlined) refer to the elements <u>before the evaluation started</u>.</li>
  <li>the operation &quot;++&quot; implies the concatenation of two OFFSETs, the result (at run
time) being the OFFSET of the second operand relative to the BASE of the first
operand. This may imply code generation. For an example, see the <u>index</u>
instruction in chapter 6.</li>
  <li>&quot;force ... value&quot; means that a descriptor of mode REF is changed to describe the
contents of the referenced area, thereby becoming VAL. This may imply code
generation. If the mode was VAL, nothing is done.</li>
</ul>
