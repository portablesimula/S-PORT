<h2>10.  <strong>TYPE CONVERSION</strong></h2>

&nbsp;
<p>	convert_instruction</p>

<p>		::=	<u>convert</u>  simple_type</p>

&nbsp;
<p>TOS must be of simple type, otherwise: error.</p>

<p>The TYPE of TOS is changed to the type specified in the instruction, this may imply code
generation. Not all conversions are valid, see the table below. An attempt to perform an
invalid conversion is an error.</p>

<p>The conversion performed will in some cases be illegal because of the actual value; one
example would be to try to convert a REAL to an INT, if the actual value of the REAL is
outside the range of INT. Such errors should be checked for at run time, in the cases
where they can occur. These conversions are marked ? in the table. The handling of
these errors at run time are described in (4).</p>

<p>Conversion from a GADDR to OADDR (AADDR) means: take the object address (attribute
address) part of the general address and return as result. An object address OADDR may
be converted to a general address GADDR. In that case the object address is extended
with an empty attribute address and the pair comprises the result.</p>

&nbsp;
<p>REAL (LREAL) to INT conversion is performed after the rule</p>

&nbsp;
<p>			INT = entier( REAL + 0.5 ).</p>

&nbsp;
<p>(Entier: the greatest integer not greater than the argument). The conversion should be
done exactly.</p>

<p>Observe that this rule does not preserve symmetry around zero; e.g. +0.5 is converted to
1, while -0.5 is converted to 0.</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	.  -	always a legal conversion, but a null operation</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	+  -	always legal and exact</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	?  -	the legality depends on the actual value being converted. Loss of accuracy
is not considered an error when converting from integer values to real
values. In other cases execution time checks may have to be inserted in
order to avoid loss of information due to truncation.</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	blank  -  always illegal.</p>
