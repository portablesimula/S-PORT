<h2>14.  <strong>SEPARATE COMPILATION</strong></h2>

<h3>14..1.  <u>Module definition</u></h3>

&nbsp;
<p>	module_definition</p>

<p>		::=	<u>module</u>  module_id:string  check_code:string</p>

<p>			visible_existing</p>

<p>			<u>body</u> &lt;local_quantity&gt;* &lt;program_element&gt;* <u>endmodule</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p>	visible_existing</p>

<p>		::=	&lt;visible&gt;*  tag_list	!  <u>existing</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p>	visible</p>

<p>		::=	record_descriptor		!  routine_profile</p>

<p>		::=	routine_specification	!  label_specification</p>

<p>		::=  constant_specification	!  insert_statement</p>

<p>		::=	info_setting</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	tag_list</p>

<p>		::=	&lt; <u>tag</u>  internal:tag  external:number &gt;+</p>

&nbsp;
<p>Rather than compiling a complete program, the S-compiler can be instructed to compile a
part of a program (a module) which subsequently will be referenced by another module or
a main program.</p>

<p>The module_id is a system-unique system-dependent identification for the module. It will
be used to locate module descriptors referenced in <u>insert</u> statements, or the descriptor of
the module itself if it is specified <u>existing</u>.</p>

<p>The check_code is an implementation-dependent code which can be used to determine
the validity of the correspondence between a module object and the compiled version of
the module it purports to describe. One possibility for this check_code is an accurate
representation of the time and date of compilation.</p>

<p>An <u>existing</u> specification in the module head informs the S-compiler that the module has
been compiled previously, and that the module head was unchanged (as well external as
internal tags occurring in the head are the same). The visible attributes of the module will
in this case be those specified visible in the earlier compilation, but changes may have
been made in the module body. Such changes do not however influence these attributes,
and the S-compiler can obtain the module head from the module descriptor file. This
means that the compilation of the module will not require recompilation of other modules
referencing this module. The check_code given in the module head must then match that
in the existing attribute file.</p>

<p>If the S-compiler encounters a module with <u>existing</u> specified, the check_code given in the
module head must match that in the existing attribute file.</p>

<p>If the module is not specified <u>existing</u>, the list of descriptors specified in the module head
specifies the externally visible attributes of the module. In order to be able to create
unique tag identification of the visible elements, the <u>tag list</u> specifies a correspondence
between the internal tags used in the module and an external number. Only tags
specifically mentioned in the tag_list are transferred via the insert instruction given in
another compilation unit; the tags defined through an insert instruction cannot themselves
be made visible outwith the module being compiled.</p>

<p>The routine specifications refer to routines defined within the module body, neither routine
profiles nor other definitions given in the head may be repeated in the body. If a profile tag
occurs in the tag_list, all the parameter tags may also occur, since the profile tag may be
associated with a routine body in another module. Label or constant specifications refer to
quantities defined in the body.</p>

<p>Any local quantities and descriptors are visible only from within the body of the module; all
such tags are destroyed at <u>endmodule</u> and made available for re-use. They are statically
allocated and part of the module throughout an execution, by analogy with Algol's
'own'-variables. Their initial values are undefined.</p>

&nbsp;
<h3>14.2.  <u>The interface module</u></h3>

&nbsp;
<p>	interface_module</p>

<p>		::=	<u>global</u> <u>module</u>  module_id:string  check_code:string</p>

<p>			 &lt;global_interface&gt;*  tag_list</p>

<p>			  <u>body</u>  &lt; <u>init</u> global:tag  type  repetition_value &gt;*</p>

<p>			<u>endmodule</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p>	global_interface</p>

<p>		::=	record_descriptor</p>

<p>		::=	constant_definition	&lt; <u>system</u>  sid:string &gt;?</p>

<p>		::=	global_definition	&lt; <u>system</u>  sid:string &gt;?</p>

<p>		::=	routine_profile</p>

<p>		::=	info_setting</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	global_definition</p>

<p>		::=	<u>global</u>  internal:newtag  quantity_descriptor</p>

<br WP="BR1"><br WP="BR2">
<p>The interface module serves two main purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it specifies a set of statically allocated variables (the globals),</li>
  <li>it specifies the interface to the system environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>An interface module is inserted as any other module with the restriction, that only one
particular interface module can ever occur in the executing program, i.e. it must be
checked that different modules do not insert different versions of the interface module.</p>

<p>A complete listing of the interface module may be found in (4).</p>

&nbsp;
<p>MAXLEN</p>

&nbsp;
<p>	This is a predefined SIZE constant with an implementation dependent value; it is
the <u>c-size</u> of the temporary area (page 35). Note that it is not the same as the
ALLOCATED attribute of this area; ALLOCATED will always be less than or equal
to the value of MAXLEN.</p>

<p>This constant is needed since it is necessary to have a special area available for a save
object in case it is not possible to allocate one dynamically without garbage collection.</p>

&nbsp;
<h4>14.2.1.  <u>Global variables</u></h4>

&nbsp;
<p>The global definition specifies static allocation of a variable of the given type, therefore
the corresponding descriptor will be complete. Each such variable is an object, and may
thus be addressed either by an object or a general address.</p>

<p>A global variable may be initialised to a given value through the <u>init</u> statement. This
initialisation must take place before execution of the program proper take place, e.g. in
connection with <u>main</u>. It is of no concern whether this is done by preloading the values, or
by executing code corresponding to the <u>init</u> statements. If a global variable is not so
initialised, the initial value is undefined.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>14.2.2.  <u>The environment interface</u></h4>

&nbsp;
<p>The S-code specification of the environment interface is given in the interface module in
the form of system profiles, system globals, and system constants.</p>

<p>The system constants are assigned values during the generation of the S-code program.
Values may also be assigned to system globals during this process, using <u>init</u>. In both
cases the S-code program is only providing default values, which the S-compiler may
chose to overwrite with values appropriate for the particular implementation.</p>

<p>All system routines are defined in this module; it is the responsibility of the S-compiler to
insert the actual instruction sequences corresponding to each routine into the body.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>14.3.  <u>The macro definition module</u></h3>

&nbsp;
<p>	macro_definition_module</p>

<p>		::=	<u>macro</u> <u>module</u>  module_id:string  check_code:string</p>

<p>			 &lt;macro_definition&gt;*  <u>endmodule</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p>The macro definition module contains the definitions of all macros used by the front end
Simula compiler (the run time system S-code will never contain macro calls). In systems
where this facility is implemented (see below) this module is implicitly inserted in the
S-compiler when it processes S-programs generated by the Simula front end compiler.
Only one macro definition module will occur in one particular release of the portable
system.</p>

<p>Macros are introduced for two purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>S-code compression, and</li>
  <li>code generation optimisation in the S-compiler.</li>
</ul>
<p>The front end compiler will be able to either generate macro calls or generate the
expansion of the call; this will be governed by a switch. Thus a particular S-compiler need
not implement the macro facility at all, as long as the Simula front end compiler is installed
with the macro expansion switch <u>on</u>.</p>

<p>The macro definition module will be accompanied by a listing of all macro definitions,
giving the symbolic S-code to be substituted at each macro call together with the rationale
for the particular macro, and a specification of the kind of the parameters and of the
parameter insertion points. This will facilitate efficient code generation for the macro
expansions.</p>

&nbsp;
<h4>14..3..1.  <u>Macro definitions</u></h4>

&nbsp;
<p>	macro_definition</p>

<p>		::=	<u>macro</u>  macro_name:byte  macro_parcount:byte</p>

<p>			  <u>known</u>  macro_id:string</p>

<p>			 &lt;macro_body_element&gt;*</p>

<p>			<u>endmacro</u></p>

&nbsp;
<p>	macro_body_element</p>

<p>		::=	<u>mark</u>  macro_sequence:string</p>

<p>		::=	<u>mpar</u>  macro_parnumber:byte</p>

&nbsp;
<p>The macro definition determines the substitution schema for the macro call processing
(see 14.3.2). The macro sequences of the body should not (and cannot) be analysed
when the definition is processed, and nested definitions are illegal. The macro_parcount
is the number of actual parameters given when the macro is called, i.e. zero means no
parameters, one means exactly one parameter in the call etc. The points at which some
actual parameter is to be inserted when the macro is expanded are marked by the
<u>mpar</u>-construction, and the parnumber refer to the place in the actual parameter list (thus
parnumber cannot be zero).</p>

<p>The macro_id names the macro in a more reasonable manner than the pair (module_id,
macro_name) does; it bears no other significance.</p>

&nbsp;
<h4>14..3..2.  <u>Macro expansion</u></h4>

&nbsp;
<p>	macro_call</p>

<p>		::=	<u>mcall</u>  macro_name:byte  &lt;actual_parameter:string&gt;*</p>

&nbsp;
<p>The effect of a macro call upon the S-compiler will be described as if the macro expansion
should take place by textual replacement in the input stream. It is emphasised that this
description is for the purpose of definition only, other and more efficient methods are of
course legal as long as the described effect is achieved.</p>

<p>When a macro call is recognised the complete state of the S-compiler is saved and the
S-compiler enters macro expansion mode. The corresponding macro definition is
identified, and the call is scanned (the number of actual parameters is given by the
definition). During the scan each actual parameter is assigned its parameter number,
beginning at one. The macro call is now replaced &quot;textually&quot; after the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All macro body elements are processed in the sequence they occur in the
definition.</li>
  <li>If the element is a macro sequence, the string contents is inserted, i.e. the &quot;length
byte&quot; of the string is removed.</li>
  <li>If the element is a parameter number, the contents of the corresponding actual
parameter string is inserted in the same manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the replacement defined above has taken place, the S-compiler leaves expansion
mode, restores the state saved and continues processing with the first inserted byte.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>14.4.  <u>Inclusion of a module</u></h3>

&nbsp;
<p>	insert_statement</p>

<p>		::=	<u>insert</u>  module_id:string  check_code:string</p>

<p>			  external_id:string tagbase:newtag  taglimit:newtag</p>

&nbsp;
<p>		::=	<u>sysinsert</u> module_id:string  check_code:string</p>

<p>			  external_id:string tagbase:newtag  taglimit:newtag</p>

&nbsp;
<p>This instruction causes the S-Compiler to include a module. The external_id is used to
identify the module with respect to an operating system. If the single character ? is given
as an external_id the S-Compiler should search the module definition library for a module
identified by the module_id. If it cannot be found or if the check code does not match, the
S-Code is in error.</p>

<p><u>sysinsert</u> is used for system modules RTS, simob etc., while <u>insert</u> is used for user
modules e.g. seperately compiled classes.</p>

<p>The visible objects of the module (as specified in the tag_list) are now brought into the
current compilation unit by adding tagbase to the external numbers specified, checking
that taglimit is not exceeded. Thus tags are allocated from the range (tagbase..taglimit).</p>

<p>Each insert instruction will have this effect, and the same module may be included several
times in the same compilation unit. The consequence of that is to create several intervals
of tags, refering the same elements in the included module.</p>

&nbsp;
<h3>14.5.  <u>Linkage of modules</u></h3>

&nbsp;
<p>The linkage of the executable code will generally be done in a manner standard to the
target system. Some knowledge about the modules must, however, be communicated to
the S-compiler: identification and type binding etc. of names external to the program being
compiled. Such information is procured from a data base (the module definition library)
maintained by the S-compiler itself. The naming conventions used, the structure of and
access method to this data base are highly system-dependent.</p>
