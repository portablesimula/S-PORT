SIMULA is a registered trademark of "Simula a.s.", Oslo, Norway.
^pg;
1.  GENERAL


The system tape contains the SIMULA system (compiler and run time system)
as a single Program File in COPIN format; this file is duplicated on the
tape, ie. the two file on the tape are identical.

Note that delivered systems will work correctly only if the Sperry Software
Site Identification is correct.

In this document the character '@' stands for Masterspace. Furthermore the
SIMULA system file is called 'S*I' for convenience, any other file name may
be used.



2.  INSTALLATION


The Program File consist of a large number of relocatable elements which
comprise the run time system. In addition three absolute elements and two
source elements are included:

        .M      (ABS)       is the SIMULA compiler
        .M-LOG  (ABS)       is the accounting program
        .M-PREP (ABS)       is the SIMULA system preparator

        .H$DEFAULT  (SYMB)  is the default parameter setting
        .SIMULA-PRM (SYMB)  is the Programmer's Reference Manual

The system may be installed as follows:

@delete,c         S*I//<writekey>
@asg,cpr          S*I//<writekey>,<type>///175
@asg,tj           TAPE,<type>,<reel identification>
@copin            TAPE.,S*I.
<delete elements, see (a)>
<assemble H$DEFAULT if necessary, see (b)>
@pack             S*I.
@prep             S*I.
@free             S*I.
@S*I.M,isv        test . A test program, eg.
begin outtext ("SIMULA installed") end
@fin

(a)  The accounting program is always included but is not relevant for
     most installations; it may thus be deleted:
     @DELETE      S*I.M-LOG

(b)  The default setting of lines per page, input and output line length,
     and the system prompt, may be changed in the element H$DEFAULT. The
     element is listed on the following page.
^pg;
.        THIS ELEMENT GIVES THE INSTALLATION PARAMETERS OF THE SYSTEM
.        CHANGES MAY BE MADE HERE AND THE ELEMENT REASSEMBLED
.        NOTE THAT THE SEQUENCE OF THE ENTRIES BELOW IS SIGNIFICANT...
$(1),H$DEFAULT*.
         +  63 .  LOGICAL NUMBER OF LINES PER PAGE
         +  80 .  SYSIN  INITIAL IMAGE LENGTH
         + 132 .  SYSOUT INITIAL IMAGE LENGTH
         ASCII.
         + 4, ( '****' ) .  LENGTH OF DEFAULT PROMPT, (ACTUAL PROMPT)
         FIELDATA.

         END.

Thus for instance the length of SYSOUT image may be changed to 72 by

@MASM,S     S*I.H$DEFAULT
-7,7-
/132/ 72/


The standard paper format used is different from installation to
installation. The delivered system assumes _63_ logical lines per page
corresponding to 12 inch paper, ie. the following format

        Max lines on physical page:   72
        Lines skipped at top:          6
        Lines skipped at bottom:       3

If the installation standard differs from this, H$DEFAULT should be changed
accordingly. The value substituted (in line 5) must be the number of
physical lines minus the number of lines skipped at top and bottom.


3.  PROGRAMMER'S REFERENCE MANUAL


The PRM is included on the tape as a DOC-formatted element in the element
SIMULA-PRM. It may be printed simply by adding the element into the run
stream. The specified format is

        @doc,efir   ,,,form,1*1.41/52(0),60/132,0/60,0*0.0/0

and the margin setting must be 72 lines per page with zero top and bottom
margins. Thus the PRM will be printed in two columns per page.

If another format is desired, the element may be edited to conformance
with any lay-out.

The installation is permitted to copy, print and distribute the manual to
the users as long as the following restrictions are adhered to:

*  The Norwegian Computing Center retains the copyright of the document;
   the Copyright claimer on the front page must not be removed.

*  The document may be distributed free of charge or for cost. It is not
   permitted to sell the manual for profit.

The PRM is also available from NCC at the address given on the front page
of this Installation Guide.
